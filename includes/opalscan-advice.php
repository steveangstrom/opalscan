/*
THE SERVER
if PHP is less than 7 give a hard warning that they can't update to the latest wp
If PHP is less than 5.6 then their server is obviously very neglected. Advise to get a host pro on the case
If SSL is not active then advise

PLUGINS ON THE SERVER
if plugins are > 10 and if there are >2 inactive plugins then advice
if Plugins installed are > 15 start really admonishing them
if there are more than 20 plugins, something strange is happing with one of their over eager interns!
If >1 installed plugins are outdated compared to the repo versions then Advise
If >3 installed plugins are outdated compared to the repo versions then strongly Advise

PLUGINS ON THE REPO
If plugins on the repo are older than 1 year then Advise
If plugins on the repo have not been updated in >2 years then strongly Advise
